Bio: This program will be a short and sweet game of 21 or "BlackJack." In this program you will face the dealer in a 1 v 1 match. There is no betting on the line, just a simple goal of beating the dealer. The program will ask you whether you want to hit or stand each turn, and it will be up to your luck and skill to beat the opponent across from you. You can play as many rounds as you like. After each one, the program will ask if you want to continue. Thanks for playing. 
The New Feature I learned and configured for my project was the random library. It works in random shuffle, to make sure the cards and truly random. And also works in random draw, so that both the dealer and the user are given two completly random cards to use. 
The challenges I faced was mostly involved in refining the logic of the game. Such as I mentioned in the presentation, the convert ace value to 1 if you have a value greather than 21 in your hands. The only piece was making sure I had two random functions from python's random library. As I discussed in the video, I changed the deck.pop to draw random to meet this requirement.
