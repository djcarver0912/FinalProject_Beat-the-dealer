Bio: This program will be a short and sweet game of 21 or "BlackJack." In this program you will face the dealer in a 1 v 1 match. There is no betting on the line, just a simple goal of beating the dealer. The program will ask you whether you want to hit or stand each turn, and it will be up to your luck and skill to beat the opponent across from you. You can play as many rounds as you like. After each one, the program will ask if you want to continue. Thanks for playing.
